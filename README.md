# ParkR
The shared parking application is introducing application as a service and sharing economy to parking. The shared parking application will be a web and mobile application that allows users to look at  a map of the area they are in, see if there are any open parking spots, and reserve that spot. Ideally, a custom map of each new area added to the application will be created to give users a simple but detailed view of their options. Owners of the spots can set when and how long the spots are available, as well as the cost of the spot. The application overall aims to reduce the amount of “wasted” private parking and open up those resources to the general public. This in turn would create a new marketplace and level of efficiency parking has never seen before.
